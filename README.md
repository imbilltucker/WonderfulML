## The Wonderful World of Machine Learning
This is the home for the sessions content for the series on Machine Learning lead by Michael Szczepaniak

### [The first session was June 29](https://www.meetup.com/Fort-Collins-Data-Science/events/240483138/)
### [Sondra's ML overview, session 1.5, was July 6](https://www.meetup.com/Fort-Collins-Data-Science/events/240982515/)

Future session are tentatively schedule for:

- 7/13 session 2 - [Linear Regression - Extreme Interpretability](https://www.meetup.com/Fort-Collins-Data-Science/events/241236268/)
- 7/20 session 3 - Logistic Regression  
- 7/27 session 4 - Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA & QDA)  
- 8/03 session 5 - Trees  
- 8/10 session 6 - Neural Nets  
- 8/17 Git: how hard can it be? (you'll need the extra week to do the NN assignment ;-)  
- 8/24 session 7 - Support Vector Machines (???)

### Proposed Agenda

The first half hour of every session is slated for review of fundamentals that will support the understanding of the algorithm(s) we'll be focusing on for next weeks assignment. For example, the supporting fundamentals for linear regression are: (1) Linear Algebra: Writing a system of equations as a matrix and solving a system of equations using Gaussian elimination. (2) Advanced Algebra & Basic Calculus: Be able to manipulate complex equations and how to differentiate functions to find minima or maxima.

The second half hour is slated for working through the current assignment which was assigned in the prior session. The last half hour will cover the material for the sessions main topic and a go over a quick description of the assignment due for the next session.

If anyone would like to volunteer to do a review fundamentals presentation in the first half hour, please let me know so we can coordinate you presentation.

I'm going to try to work in concepts such as how to train models with boostrap methods like bagging, random forest and boosting as well as how the main cross-validation techniques work, but we may not have enough time to do much with these areas. Let me know your thoughts on how how these sessions might be more beneficial to you!
