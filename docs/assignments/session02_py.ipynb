If you are relatively new to the area of machine learning, the first reference will be your friend.  If you are an experienced pro, have great math skills and/or need more depth on a particular topic, the second reference is an excellent reference.

    "4) You are thinking about using logistic regression to determine if your stock trading has a chance of making you some money.  You design your own signal variable x which you derive from data that is readily available and use it to back-test your model on historical data.  You simulate a trade for various values of x and assign a value of 1 if the trade made money and a 0 if it lost money.  You plot your data, fit a sigmoid function through the data, and it looks like this:\n",
