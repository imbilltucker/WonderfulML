<h2>The Wonderful World of ML - Session 1 Assignment</h2><br>

<ol>
  <li>Install jupyter notebook and configure it with an R kernel if you are an R user.  If you are Python user, your Anaconda install will have Python configured out of the box.</li><br><br><br>
  <li>What is machine learning?  Describe 3 examples.</li><br><br><br>
  <li>What is the difference between a probability mass function and probability density function?</li><br><br><br>
  <li>The National Sleep Foundation (www.sleepfoundation.org) reports that around 3% of the American population has sleep apnea. They also report that around 10% of the North American and European population has restless leg syndrome. Does this imply that 13% of people will have at least one sleep problems of these sorts?</li><br><br><br>
  <li>Given two binary random variables: D = having a disease (true or false) and T = test results for a disease (+ or -), derive the formula for the probability of having a disease given a positive test result p(D=true | T=+) aka <b>positive predictive value</b>.</li><br><br><br>
  <li>Rewrite this formula in terms of sensitivity p(T=+ | D=true) and specificity p(T=- | D=false) of the test.</li><br><br><br>
  <li>If the probability of having disease D is 1% in the popultation and a test that diagnoses this disease is accurate 80% of the time, what is the probability that a person with a + test result has the disease if the test gives a false positive 9.6% of the time?</li><br><br><br>
  <li>Say the mean of some population is the value m, if we take a random sample of 50 item from this population, compute the mean, put that sample back into the population, repeat this 1000 times and plot the distibution, what would the shape of this distribution of sample means look like?  What would we expect the mean of this distribution to be?</li><br><br><br>
  <li>Say I have a function of two variables x1 and x2 which I want to find the minimum of.  A contour plot of f(x1, x2) looks like this:<br><br><br>

  <br><br>If I start my search at point A and I use gradient descent, what direction would my next guess be in?<br><br><br>
  </li>
  <li>Most of know how to compute an average aka a mean.  Can you describe where the formula for the mean comes from?  How is it derived?  How about the standard deviation?</li><br><br><br>
</ol>
