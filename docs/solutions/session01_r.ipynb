    "There are two key differences between a **probability mass function (PMF)** and a **probability density function (PDF)**.  The first difference is the type of data each function is used to describe.  A PMF is typically used to describe **discrete** distributions.  That is, the values being considered can only take on a finite number of values (e.g. the roll of die or the flip of coin).  A PDF is typically used to discribe continuous data.  That is, the values being considered can take on an infinite number of values (e.g. temperature measurements, fuel efficiency of a car in miles per gallon).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second difference is the type of output each function produces.  A PMF maps a discrete value to a probability.  Since the output of PMF is a probability, each output value must lie between 0 and 1.  A PDF maps a continuous value to a probability **density**, not an actual probability.  To compute an actual probability from a PDF, you must specify an interval for the input (e.g. temperature between 70.2 and 76.3F) and the calculate the area under the curve (AUC) in the interval in which you are interested.  This area will be equal to the probability that the input value will be observed in the given range relative to values outside the given range.\n",
